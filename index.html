      <p>I am currently a UX Master’s student at the University of Michigan’s School of Information. I graduated from Cazenovia College in 2015 with a major in Interior Design and a minor in Graphic Design. After graduating, I worked in the hospitality field for approximately 5 years in Orlando, FL. I designed coffee shops, guest rooms, lobbies, restaurants, and sales centers. Though I enjoyed my time at these companies, and gained valuable insight, through my experiences I came to realize that I have a passion for UX design that led me to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Michigan.</p>

      <p>This passion for computers and design has brought me to UX design. I am passionate about streamlining and simplifying the user experience where the learning curve is next to none. I grew up using Windows 95 and browsing the web; I got excited when every new visual update/version of Windows came out. I am fascinated by old interfaces and how they have evolved from a command line to a start button in Windows 95. I have found that UX design has the perfect blend of design and my passions which combines computers and design.</p>
